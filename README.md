# Image Processing

- Image processing python scripts and resulting images

## Interpolate Image
- merge 2 images evenly across the entire image
- allows the production of transparent objects

## Incremental Image
- merge 2 images incrementally by each column of pixels
- The first column will be 100% the first image, the last column will be 100% the second image and interpolate between the two

## Emphasize Color
- emphasizing a chosen color (Red, Green, or Blue) and grayscaling the rest of the image
